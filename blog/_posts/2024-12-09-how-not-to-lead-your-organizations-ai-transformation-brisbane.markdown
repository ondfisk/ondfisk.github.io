Talk given at [*YOW!*](https://yowcon.com/) in [Brisbane December 9, 2024](https://yowcon.com/brisbane-2024/speakers/3538/rasmus-lystroem).

## Abstract

In this talk I present four leadership strategies for adopting generative AI:

1. Leadership strategy no. 1: We'll wait it out aka "FUD"
1. Leadership strategy no. 2: We'll build our own version of ChatGPT aka "Copycat"
1. Leadership strategy no. 3: Hire a CAIO or maybe a CAITO aka "New Silo"
1. Leadership strategy no. 4: Enable a paid service for everyone

Having chosen one the any of the above inevitably your people are now leveraging generative AI to do work.

I then continue discussing the benefits and drawbacks of using generative AI - particularly to boost developer productivity.

The second part of the talk discusses how to change the organisation and skip the platform trap to support developing new solutions powered by AI.

As a final note I present a perspective asking "Why is AI going the the wrong direction?"

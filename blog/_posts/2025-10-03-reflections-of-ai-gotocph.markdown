Talk given at [*GOTO; Copenhagen 2025*](https://gotocph.com/2025/sessions/3743/reflections-of-ai-a-trilogy-in-four-parts) October 3, 2025.

Reflecting on the era of AI, I present my views as "A Trilogy in Four Parts":

The impact of generative AI adoption
The [hidden] price of AI adoption
Useful AI in a world saturated with LLMs
How to build [valuable AI] solutions
We start with a nod to Douglas Adams and discussion on the latest research showing the dark side of AI but ends on a silver lining on possible uses of AI.

I promise a mix of rants, wakeup calls, and laughs.
